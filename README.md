__"Aliens-R-Real" report__ 

__Directory__
index.html is the main HTML file

* Static folder contains the main CSS code (style.css) and main JS code (app.js)

* Archieve Folder contains draft work on bonus saved in various Draft app.py files (also early draft of functional HTML with additional buttons) Additional files retained for future code exploration.

**Goal #1:**
Display UFO data as a chart which is searchable by date. 

**Goal #2 (bonus):**
Include additional categories for searching. 
>> Bonus challenge: include search fields for the additional categories. Search buttons work independently of additional data being present (i.e. you can search for a single item or several items and blank fields do not
impede the code)



__Extras: UX improvements__
* Button color changed for improved visibilty

* RESET button included
